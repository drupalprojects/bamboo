Version 1.5, November 18, 2012

-- SUMMARY --

Bamboo is a responsive Drupal 7 theme that allows for a choice of backgrounds, color palettes, and fonts
in the theme's settings page. Bamboo is aimed at users who want to get a theme up and running
fast, and may not want to take the time to create a sub-theme and fuss about
with regions, settings, media queries, and other super technical things. It's also aimed at the
casual Drupal user who has some familiarity with building sites. This is designed with this type of user
in mind, so it may not be for the developer per se who would most likely use Omega or Zen.
This theme also does not require any base theme.

-- FEATURES --

- Google Fonts included with a choice of Fonts (e.g, choose sans-serif or serif
for headers)

- Choice of several backgrounds and textures

- Choice of three color palettes

- JQuery Image captions on default imagefield in Article content type

- Responsive for phone, tablet, and desktop using media queries

- PSD image template files included

- Mobile friendly menu

- Drop down menus (for desktop)

- CSS3 PIE support for CSS3 features in IE8.
*** See the Notes below in regard to

-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* As with any other Drupal theme you are able to customize just about every
aspect of this theme but some nice defaults are provided out of the box.

- drupal.org theme guide is here : http://drupal.org/documentation/theme

- it is recommended to create a sub-theme of your own to put all your overrides
in : Creating a sub-theme - http://drupal.org/node/225125

-- NOTES --

- This theme supports CSS3 features, i.e. round corners using CSS3 PIE
for IE8 but you will need to download the Library from http://css3pie.com/ and
put it in /sites/all/libraries and also make sure you have the Drupal Libraries
Module installed. You will also need to uncomment the PIE specific code
in the ie8-fixes CSS file located in the CSS folder of this theme.

- Be sure to take a look at CSS3 PIE known issues if you are having
issues with IE8 and CSS3:
http://css3pie.com/documentation/known-issues

- Media Queries will not work in IE8 but IE8 gracefully degrades to
a 960 layout.

- Inspiration for this theme comes from my surroundings in glorious sunny
Southern California!

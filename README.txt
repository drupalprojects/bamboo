-- SUMMARY --

Bamboo is a bespoke responsive Drupal 7 theme with an elegant home page
slideshow, and allows for a choice of backgrounds and color palettes in the
theme settings.bamboo is aimed at users who want to get a theme up and running
fast, and may not want to take the time to create a sub-theme and fuss about
with regions, settings, media queries, and other super technical things. I
designed with this type of user in mind, so it may not be for the developer per
se. This theme also does not require any base theme.

-- FEATURES --

- Google Fonts included with a choice of Fonts (e.g, choose sans-serif or serif
for headers)

- Home page slide show (Flexslider, choice of 2 styles)

- Choice of several backgrounds and textures

- Choice of three color palettes

- Responsive for phone, tablet, and desktop using media queries

- PSD image template files included

- Mobile friendly menu

- Drop down menus (for desktop)

- CSS3 PIE support for CSS3 features in IE8.
*** See the Notes below in regard to
installation  and usage of CSS3 PIE

-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* As with any other Drupal theme you are able to customize just about every
aspect of this theme.

- drupal.org theme guide is here : http://drupal.org/documentation/theme

- it is recommended to create a sub-theme of your own to put all your overrides
in : Creating a sub-theme - http://drupal.org/node/225125

-- NOTES --

- This theme supports CSS3 features, i.e. round corners using CSS3 PIE
for IE8 but you will need to download the Library from http://css3pie.com/ and
put it in /sites/all/libraries and also make sure you have the Drupal Libraries
Module installed. You will also need to uncomment the PIE specific code
in the ie8-fixes CSS file located in the CSS folder of this theme.

- Be sure to take a look at CSS3 PIE known issues if you are having
issues with IE8 and CSS3:
http://css3pie.com/documentation/known-issues

- Media Queries will not work in IE8 but IE8 gracefully degrades to
a 960 layout.

- The photos in the slideshow are my own, so there shouldn't be issues regarding
to copyright et al; I am giving full usage rights if someone wants to keep them
in the theme, but of course feel free to use your own. You can see more at

- Inspiration for this theme comes from my surroundings in glorious sunny
Southern California!
